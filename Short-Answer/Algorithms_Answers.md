#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1) - This solution is ideal because the runtime and space used is completely unaffected by the size of the input.


b) O(n^c) - Not a very scalable solution because as the size of the input increases the runtime and space used will grow at faster a rate.


c) O(c^n) - This solution is pretty inefficient because of the size of the input increase. The runtime and space used in this solution will grow at a much faster rate.

## Exercise II

pseudocode

1. Create a function called n_story with a argument of floor and egg

2. determine the value of f by making a variable equal to the length of the argument

3. Make an if statement declaring if an ege is thrown off floor f the egg get's broken elif egg doesn't get broken when thrown off a floor less than floor f
